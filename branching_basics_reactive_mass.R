  # Here we generate new cases from a branching process using the state of 'out'
  # above. The algorithm is:
  
  # 1. Determine the force of infection, i.e. the average number of new cases
  # generated.
  #
  # 2. Draw the number of new cases.
  #
  # 3. Draw features of the new cases.
  #
  # 4. Append new cases to the linelist of cases.

  # individual 'i', it is determined as:
  #
  # lambda_i = R_i * w(t - onset_i)
  #
  # where 'w' is the PMF of the serial interval, 't' the current time, and
  # 'onset_i' the date of onset of case 'i'.
